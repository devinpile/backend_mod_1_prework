## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
There several points of the SuperLearner Article that I already apply such as understanding that learning is process, as well as teaching what you've learned is one of the best ways to retain new information; the biggest take away that I will adopt to my own process is to take breaks often. Allowing your brain to have space to process the new information is very important.
1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
p "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
  # you can use a hashtag/pound/octothorpe character to make comments that ruby with ignore.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
Integers are dealing with whole numbers that can include 0 and negative numbers, whereas a float deals with a number that has a decimal point.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation is the insertion of something of a different nature in something else. So if I wanted to include 'animal' in my code using string interpolation then this could be an example:
animal = "zebra"
p "The #{animal} was running through the field"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
To get input from a user you can set the variable using "get.chomp" method

1. Name and describe two common string methods: String Concatenation is a simplistic approach where you can join strings together with the plus sign, and String Interpolation where we can stick data into the middle of the string like filling a blank.
