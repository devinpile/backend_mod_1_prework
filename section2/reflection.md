## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I feel my question asking is circumstantial to the situation; I feel sometimes I ask questions too soon but mostly I wait too long to ask questions. Throughout my work I have been able to be more cognizant of which situations constitute asking for help versus the times where I just need to stick with it a bit longer.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement dictates a parameter; they are way a computer makes a decision. Conditional statement always have an if part, which tells the app what to do when the condition is true.
1.if the user can't input the access code, then do not allow entrance
2.if the user presses a button for allergies, then redirect to special menu options
3.if the statement is true, then proceed with following questions

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
If-statement allows you to branch your code, giving you the ability be way more complex and have more user interaction.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
1.if (condition1)
2.//code to be executed IF condition1 is true
3.elsif (condition2)
4.//code to be executed IF condition2 is true
5.else (condition3)
6.//code to be executed IF condition3 is true
7.end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
using the if , elsif , else syntax

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
if team1_points > team2_points
  puts "Team 1 Wins!!"
elsif team1_points < team2_points
  puts "Team 2 Wins!!"
else team1_points = team2_points
  puts "Actually it was a terrible game..."

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
You can also use conditional statements in Boolean (true/false) to create branches in the same way.

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
The method groups a  "box" of code together to make it easier to work with.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
  print "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  Puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
def hello_someone(name)
name = Sam
  puts = "#{name} I am"
end

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
I know I understand it, but I don't think I'm not doing it correctly yet; I'm sure there's a question in there. I think I just need to come back to this again later. I want to ask a good a question, but I need more grasp.
